# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

### The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Perform a Docker build
# - Push the built image to an image registry
# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet.

### Before you begin:
# - Have write access to a container image registry such as quay.io or Dockerhub.
# - Have access to an OpenShift cluster.
#   - For instructions to get started with OpenShift see https://www.openshift.com/try
# - The project you wish to add this workflow to should have a Dockerfile.
#   - If you don't have a Dockerfile at the repository root, see the buildah-build step.
#   - Builds from scratch are also available, but require more configuration.

### To get the workflow running:
# 1. Add this workflow to your repository.
# 2. Edit the top-level 'env' section, which contains a list of environment variables that must be configured.
# 3. Create the secrets referenced in the 'env' section under your repository Settings.
# 4. Edit the 'branches' in the 'on' section to trigger the workflow on a push to your branch.
# 5. Commit and push your changes.
